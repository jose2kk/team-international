# Team International Challenge

The challenge is to create a program that computes some basic statistics on a collection of small positive integers. You can assume all values will be less than 1,000.

## Requirements
The DataCapture object accepts numbers and returns an object for querying statistics about the inputs. Specifically, the returned object supports querying how many numbers in the collection are less than a value, greater than a value, or within a range.

Hereâ€™s the program skeleton in Python to explain the structure:

capture = DataCapture()
capture.add(3)
capture.add(9)
capture.add(3)
capture.add(4)
capture.add(6)
stats = capture.build_stats()
stats.less(4) # should return 2 (only two values 3, 3 are less than 4)
stats.between(3, 6) # should return 4 (3, 3, 4 and 6 are between 3 and 6)
stats.greater(4) # should return 2 (6 and 9 are the only two values greater than 4)

## Challenge Conditions
You cannot import a library that solves it instantly
o The methods add(), less(), greater(), and between() should have
constant time O(1)
o The method build_stats() can be at most linear O(n) o Apply the best practices you know.
